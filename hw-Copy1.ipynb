    "Supervised learning is a component of machine learning. The goal is to teach machines to predict an outcome, Y, with the highest accuracy based on the inputs it's been given, X. The machine or computer is provided a dataset that has be preprocessed/cleaned before teaching the machine to recognize patterns between X and Y to make predictions. The data is split into a training and testing set; train the machine on the training set, then test how accurate the predictive models are at making accurate predictions by using the unseen data, the test set.\n",

It predicts the label of any unknown data point by looking at the K, the number of nearest neighbors, and the closest labeled data or neighbors votes on what label the unlabeled point should have. The class with the most votes determines the label\n",
    "    - to find the nearest data points to the unknown data point, euclidean distance is used to calculate the distance. K, the number of neighbors and hyperparameter, is dependent on the dataset and needs to decided before building the model. Small number of neighbors = more flexible fit, low bias but high variance. Large number of neighbors= smoother decision boundary, lower variance, but high bias; also computationally expensive (meaning large number of steps to complete)\n",
